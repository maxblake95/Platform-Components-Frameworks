# Platform-Components-Frameworks

PCF was created to aid integration between the quant platforms and to drive code reuse and the adoption of best practices across 
the entire engineering division. 

The extremely high value of the firm’s IP requires that source code and built binaries be carefully protected with both permission 
structure and encryption. This is currently a huge area of focus with lots of green-field development.

We’re facing super interesting Computer Science problems within this space right now. Complicated caching; solving performance issues of 
using GIT at enterprise scale; making it possible for teams to share code while maintaining a loose coupling; trying to take 
the OSS Google build system Bazel and make it work with .NET Core and much much more.
